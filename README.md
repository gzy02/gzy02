### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a master's student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, having previously completed my undergraduate studies at Tongji University. Currently, I'm an intern at Tencent WeChat, where I'm engaged in research and development in the exciting fields of Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

My research interests lie in the area of GraphRAG, and I have authored three publications in the this domain. You can find more details about my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dwK9KT4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/387/0715.html) profiles.

I'm passionate about building innovative solutions and contributing to the open-source community. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!
